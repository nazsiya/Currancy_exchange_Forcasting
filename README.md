# 🌐 Currency Exchange Rate Forecasting Readme

## 📋 Overview
Currency Exchange Rate Forecasting using Python is a comprehensive guide that helps users understand how to predict fluctuations in currency exchange rates. This is crucial for individuals, businesses, and financial institutions to make informed decisions, manage risk, and optimize currency conversions. The guide covers steps from data preparation to time series forecasting using the SARIMA model.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **📊 Dataset**: Download the dataset containing weekly exchange rates between INR and USD from [here](link_to_dataset). Ensure you have Python installed.

2. **📚 Libraries**: Install the required Python libraries using the following:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn pmdarima
    ```

3. **🏃 Run the Code**: Open a Python environment and run the provided code for data loading, cleaning, and analysis.

## 📁 Code Structure
1. **🔄 Data Loading and Cleaning**: The guide starts with importing necessary Python libraries and loading the dataset. Missing values are handled appropriately.

2. **📊 Descriptive Statistics**: Descriptive statistics of the dataset are provided to understand its characteristics.
